# Hangman
Hangman Game
Individual Project – Research Program
A Python-based Hangman game with a GUI, built as part of a research program. Designed and coded the game logic from scratch, including a responsive interface with random words genrator and an aesthetic color theme. Future plans include adding multiplayer modes, leaderboards, and a unique “Quizman” mode.

Tech used: Python [entirely myself], Tkinter[opensource and other resources, I edited the code to present it the way I imagined]
