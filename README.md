# 🎮 Hangman

**Individual Project – Research Program**

A Python-based Hangman game with a GUI, built as part of a research program.  
I designed and coded the game logic entirely from scratch, featuring a responsive interface, a random word generator, and a custom color theme.  
Planned upgrades include multiplayer modes, leaderboards, and a unique “Quizman” mode.  

**Tech used:**  
- Python (fully self-coded)  
- Tkinter (adapted from open-source & other resources to match my design vision)
